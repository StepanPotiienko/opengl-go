## Contributing

If you are eager to grow and develop as a programmer, feel free to contribute to this repository. You can do so by following these simple steps:

- Clone the repository to your local hard drive:
  `git clone https://github.com/StepanPotiienko/opengl-go`
- To keep up with the most recent updates: `git pull & git fetch`.
- Avoid commiting to the 'main' branch by creating your own (replace {branch_name} with your own, unique name for a branch): `git checkout -b {branch_name}`.
- Write code.
  - Code should be written according to the standarts, be easy to read and working correctly.
- Create a commit (replace {Commit description with your own description of the changes you've made}): `git add . & git commit -a -m "{Commit description}`.
- Push! `git push --set-upstream origin {branch_name}`
- Create a Pull Request.
  - There will be like a huge button "Create Pull Request" so I believe you should not get lost here. (-:
- Wait for approval.
